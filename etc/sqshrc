# sqshrc - Global sqshrc initialization file. This file is
#          installed as part of sqsh to act as a global
#          resource file for all users of sqsh.

# $semicolon_hack : This turns on the ability to use a semicolon as
#             a sort of in-line go.  It is kind of hacky but seems
#             to work pretty well.

#
# $prompt :   The value of this variable is expanded each time the
#             prompt is displayed.  It may contain variables and
#             even command substitutions (note that $date and $time
#             are the more efficient ways of displaying the current
#             date than `date`).

#
# $histsize : This variable is used to configure the number of 
#             previous batches that have been executed by sqsh,
#             setting this variable high uses up a little extra
#             memory, and makes it a little harder to find the
#             query that you are looking for, but comes in handy.
#
\set histsize=20

#
# $exit_failcount : This variable causes sqsh to exit with an exit
#             status of the total number of batches that failed
#             during the current session. This is useful for use 
#             within shell scripts and the such.
#
\set exit_failcount=on

#
# $history_shorthand : Turns on the ability to perform csh-style
#             history recall on the command line, such as !20.
#
\set history_shorthand=on

#
# The following alias is used to act as a replacement for the
# '\go | more' command. It is smart enough to carry over any
# parameters to \go.  If you always want "more" support then
# you can do "\alias \go='\go !* | more'".
# 
\alias mo='\go !* | more'

#
# The following alias's create a more 'isql-like' environment.
#
\alias :r='\buf-load -a !*'
